    <p>The reason on why I am writing this is to show my interest within the track of quality assurance because the idea of new software and technology has always fascinated me. It is something that I have always had interest in, even though I realize what is required of me I will see it through no matter what.<br><br>
I know that being a QA trainee requires paying close attention to detail, training others to use programs as well as hardware, and working with a team to solve major errors. Right now I am currently taking extra classes that teach web development where the slightest mistake and destroy an entire page. Through that I am able to learn just how important details are and how effective it is to look for errors within codes. When it comes to training others I have taught my fellow colleagues how to create websites and the basics of excel to where they can complete similar tasks on their own. I have been in several groups working to complete projects by certain deadlines, and have managed to succeed with all my projects. With all these skills I feel that I would be the perfect fit for this position, also because I feel that I have more than enough potential to undertake this track.<br><br>
I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter and look forward to hearing back from you. The best way to contact me is through email: mbutilla@sfo.yearup.org.<br><br>

Best Regards,<br><br>
