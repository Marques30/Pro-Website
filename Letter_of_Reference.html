It is an honor to write a letter of recommendation for Marques Butilla. I have known him since the start of Year Up class 15.<br><br>

Marques is such an amazing person. He is always trying to help his colleagues by making sure that they understand how to do each project or task.

He does not turn anyone down and is always willing to lend a helping hand.<br><br>

He is very knowledgeable in Web Development and Microsoft Excel. He is always tackling each project right after its assigned and finishes it within a couple of hours. His final website project was amazing because he utilizes many JavaScript to make the webpage entertaining to the user. During his downtime, he is always asking his colleagues if they need any help.<br><br>

It is a great pleasure to work alongside with Marques. He excels in all of the trainings. He has many great suggestions and advices to offer. He is the most kind-hearted and open minded person I’ve met.<br><br>

      It is a great pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Marques Butilla. I have known him since the start of Year Up class 15.<br><br>

Marques is amazing in everything that he does. It shows in all of his work. His public speaking skills is number one compared to the rest of his colleagues. When we did the monologue speech, everyone stopped in their track just to listen to his speech because it was that powerful. The way he emphasizes each word along with the strong tone and impactful pauses made him an amazing public speaker.<br><br>

He works amazingly well with others whether it’s the people he sees every day or people that he just recently met. He has a way of communicating with people and getting all of them to cooperate. He is always lending a helping hand to his colleagues and contributing in all group projects.<br><br>

He excels in all of the trainings. Not only is he in the Quality Assurance Track, but he is taking on many other electives to improve his technical skills such as Udacity and JavaScript. He utilizes these skills and created an amazing website. The main page consists of a gate that you have to enter in order to proceed to the website. His website consists of many HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes.<br><br>

Marques will be a huge asset to the company. If you would like more information about Mark, feel free to contact me at 415-999-1541.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

Mark Bihag

    <p>I have gotten the chance to get to know Marques these past couple of months and he's someone I can rely heavily on. He is always sacrificing his time to help others succeed in this program. He always gets his work done before everyone with excellent quality. I see Marques as someone who is highly respected and very knowledgeable. His proficiency in his web development skills and also his ability to take on any task that is given to him will take him a long way.<br><br>

Marques is a great team player and works well in group projects. He has the ability to be a leader and also someone who contributes well thought out ideas to benefit everyone around him. Marques shows up on time everyday with a positive attitude and ready to work. I know Marques will succeed in any role and will be able to consistently perform at a high level on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <p>Hello, I am Eduardo Cuevas from Year Up. But enough about me, I want to tell you why Marques is the best candidate for any position he will be headed to, and why you need him on your team. Have you ever had a time where the day drags on forever? Or needed to have someone to collaborate effectively and get the job done. Then Marques is your go-to guy!<br><br>

Over the past 4 months I’ve had the privilege of working with Marques at Year Up. At first he wasn’t very provocative in the training room, but soon found his strengths and played on the ever since. He has a great aptitude for learning, and is even teaching his peers on concepts that are difficult to understand.<br><br>

He demonstrates not only his retainment of knowledge, but also his ability to teach information that is easy to understand and apply. He is proficient in coding, so much in fact that he’s been accepted in Udacity’s training program. He also is excellent in Microsoft office suite, such excel and word. He actually started a mock study group in which he led the teaching for an excel project.<br><br>

Again, Marques is the person you want to hire. The choice isn’t hard to see, He’s going to be your greatest asset. If you take the chance that is.<br><br>

From,<br><br>

Eduardo Cuevas
